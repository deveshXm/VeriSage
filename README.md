VeriSage is a  platform that simplifies the process of requesting and verifying certificates. It offers a secure and transparent way to manage and authenticate your achievements.


## Features

- **Certificate Requests**: Users can request certificates from educational institutions, certification authorities, or any organization that issues certificates.

- **Verification**: Verify the authenticity of certificates by checking them against the blockchain, ensuring trust and accuracy.

- **Blockchain Technology**: Built on [Blockchain Platform Name], providing an immutable and transparent ledger for secure record-keeping.

- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls the data, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and certificate management.

- **Smart Contracts**: Utilizes smart contracts for requesting, issuing, and verifying certificates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) - Development framework for Ethereum
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) - Local blockchain for testing
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) - Ethereum wallet and gateway to blockchain apps

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verisage.git
   cd verisage


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
